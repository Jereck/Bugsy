A Bug Manager built with C#

# Backend
ASP.NET Core Web API will function as the backend

# Database
SQLite will be the development database, and probably Microsoft SQL Server will be production (or Azure?)

# Frontend
Debating on what would be the best framework to use on the Front-end and how I want to design it.
- Thinking a drag-and-drop style Kanban board might be fun for bug states.
